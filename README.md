# Exclusive-checkboxes
Ensure a user can only select a single checkbox when records are displayed in a table on a Visualforce page.  In this example, only one "main contact" can be selected from a list of account contacts.

This code is the solution to a blog post I did recently, which can be found <a href="https://chriswritescode.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/checkboxes-ensuring-a-user-can-only-select-one-checkbox-in-a-visualforce-page/">here</a>.
